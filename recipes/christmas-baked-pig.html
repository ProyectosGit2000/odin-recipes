It consists of a pork marinated with native chilies of the country, garlic, silao, black beer, spices and herbs. Actually, you will need few ingredients, and it does not require much care or much time to cook it.

   <h2>How to make Christmas baked pork:</h2>
   <p>
      Start by cleaning and submerging the pork pieces in brine, that is, fill a dish with plenty of water to cover the pork and add 10% of the weight in salt. Stir well and submerge the pig there, let it rest for 2 to 3 hours and then rinse it.
   </p>
   <p>
      Cut the skin or leather of the pig. To do this, make diagonal cuts leaving two fingers of space between each cut. Make sure that the cut is only on the fat part without going into the lean part. Then, make other cuts crosswise to obtain rhombuses. Place these pieces on a tray with high edges, suitable for the oven.
   </p>
   <p>
      Separately, in a small bowl prepare the dressing. Pour in the panca chili paste, the ground garlic, the silao and a splash of vinegar. Also add the spices and herbs: ground cumin, ground black pepper, ground dried oregano, dried rosemary and salt to taste.
   </p>
   <p>
      Mix well and pour in the black beer.
   </p>
   <p>
      Pour this dressing over the pork pieces, massage them well and make sure the dressing gets into the corners where the cuts were made. Let it marinate for at least 2 hours, although it is better if you leave it in the refrigerator overnight.
   </p>
   <p>
      The next day, preheat the oven to 170 °C, remove the pork tray from the refrigerator and squeeze the juice of an orange onto the surface. Then, cover with aluminum foil and bake for 1 hour. After the hour, remove the aluminum foil so that the skin browns and becomes crispy. Let it bake for another hour or until the meat is cooked through.

      Finally, remove the Christmas pig from the oven, let it cool for 10 minutes and serve immediately. Enjoy! Tell us your opinion in the comments and share with us a photograph of the final result.
