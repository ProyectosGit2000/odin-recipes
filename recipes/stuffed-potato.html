   <h2>What is this dish about?</h2>
   <p>
      The stuffed potato is one of our most emblematic dishes; a combination of techniques and ingredients that has evolved over time and adapted to different territories and customs. A stuffed potato in the market, accompanied by Creole sauce, or with a little ceviche, as is customary in the north.
   </p>
   <p>
      The origin of this noble dish is, like many others in our Creole recipes, uncertain. Although it is not difficult to imagine that before the arrival of the Spanish in the 15th century, it was already customary to process the potato and accompany it with meat: fish or llama, as a cause.
   </p>
   <p>
      However, the stuffed potato, as we know it now—fried and stuffed with seasoned beef or chicken—was developed during the Colony, as a snack in a snack bar or tavern. It is also not difficult to imagine the vianderas offering stuffed chips on the streets of old Lima, just as picarones were also offered.
   </p>
   <p>
      There are those who maintain that its origin would be in Afro-descendant communities; male and female slaves, or freedmen, for the type of seasoning used to flavor the meats. It is not unreasonable to associate stuffed chips with Spanish croquettes either.

   <h2>Stuffed potato ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
      <li>250 Grams of Ground Beef</li>
      <li>2 White Potatoes</li>
      <li>3 Yellow Potatoes</li>
      <li>2 MAGGI® Meat Flavor Cubes</li>
      <li>1 Red Onion</li>
      <li>2 Tablespoons of Black Raisins</li>
      <li>4 Units of Black Olives</li>
      <li>1 Pinch of Pepper</li>
      <li>1 Teaspoon of Ground Garlic</li>
      <li>1 Tablespoon of Ground Chili Panca</li>
      <li>1/2 Cup of Wheat Flour</li>
      <li>1 Cup of Vegetable Oil</li>
      <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Let's cook!</h2>
   <p>
      Parboil the potatoes by placing them in a pot with enough water to cover them completely. Cook them for 15 to 20 minutes from when the water boils. The yellow potatoes will be ready before the white potatoes, therefore it is recommended to remove them from the pot and let the white potatoes cook for 5 more minutes.
   </p>
   <p>
      Once cooked, peel them and press them in a large bowl. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Reserve the dough.
   </p>
   <p>
      Heat 4 tablespoons of oil in a frying pan. Add the onion and sweat for 2 minutes. Add the garlic, the panca chili and fry for 2 more minutes.
   </p>
   <p>
      Add the ground beef, two MAGGI® Meat Flavor cubes and 1/4 cup of water. Cook for 5 minutes over low heat. Add the raisins and olives cut into rings. Cook for another 5 minutes.
   </p>
   <p>
      Divide the potato dough into 4 equal parts. Select one of the parts of the potato dough and shape it into a concave shape with the help of the palm of your hands, leaving a space in the center to place the filling. Place 1 tablespoon of the filling and little by little close the stuffed potato, making sure it is completely closed. Repeat the process with all the potato dough.
   </p>
   <p>
      Heat 1 cup of oil in a small pot. Dredge each stuffed potato in the flour and place them on a plate, making sure to remove any excess flour before frying them.
   </p>
   <p>
      Carefully place each stuffed potato in the pot with oil and fry each potato for 5 minutes, rotating until evenly browned. Remove and drain.
   </p>
   <p>
      Serve.
